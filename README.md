## Background

This is a hobby project done to solve a real issue of easily knowing what one can hunt on a given day. Typically hunting times are provided as a long list of game animal species and their respective hunting seasons.

For example a moose or duck hunter knows exactly when that animal's hunting season is. But for the occasional weekend hunter, for whom the free weekends are scarce, that kind of approach does not work. It's more about _when_ one can go for a hunt, than when the season for a specific game animal is. So when finally being able to go for a hunt on a free weekend, instead of reading through long lists and trying to mentally filter out all animals, that have the hunting season at the time, one can just check this app for what species one can hunt on that day.
